<!---
At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)
--->

SimplePhpTranslate is a PHP component and it allows you to easily insert translated text into web pages.

## Motivation

<!---
A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

 - You cannot 

## Code Example

<!---
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.
--->

Please have a look at fully commented source code in <code>sample-client</code> directory. 
For a working example, please have a look at <code>test</code> directory.
