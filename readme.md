## SimplePhpTranslate

<!---
At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)
--->

*SimplePhpTranslate* is a PHP component and it allows you to easily insert translated text into web pages. Project home page is [here](http://braincrumbz.github.io/simple-php-translate/)

## Motivation

<!---
A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.
--->

*SimplePhpTranslate* is a simple (quick and dirty?) solution when you need some translation mechanism in a PHP project and cannot/don't want to 
use a more structured translation framework.  
Think of scenarios like:

 - Your project does not include any framework that already provides translation out-of-the-box (e.g. Zend)
 - Your web hosting provider has not enabled *gettext* PHP extension
 - You cannot/don't want to install *gettext* extension, e.g. because you're working on Windows environment, 
 or you don't feel like learning how to do that :smile: yet

## Code Example

<!---
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.
--->

Please have a look at fully commented source code in `sample-client` directory. 

For a working example, please have a look at `test` directory. You can fire-up your web server and browse to `index.html` in that directory. 
If you like, you can find test page setup instructions for Apache under the `Deploy\Dev\Web Server` directory.
