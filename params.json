{"name":"Simple-php-translate","tagline":"A PHP component to use localised text resources into web pages.","body":"## SimplePhpTranslate\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nAt the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)\r\n--->\r\n\r\n*SimplePhpTranslate* is a PHP component and it allows you to easily insert translated text into web pages.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nA short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.\r\n--->\r\n\r\n*SimplePhpTranslate* is a simple (quick and dirty?) solution when you need some translation mechanism in a PHP project and cannot/don't want to \r\nuse a more structured translation framework.  \r\nThink of scenarios like:\r\n\r\n - Your project does not include any framework that already provides translation out-of-the-box (e.g. Zend)\r\n - Your web hosting provider has not enabled *gettext* PHP extension\r\n - You cannot/don't want to install *gettext* extension, e.g. because you're working on Windows environment, \r\n or you don't feel like learning how to do that :smile: yet\r\n\r\n## Code Example\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nShow what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.\r\n--->\r\n\r\nPlease have a look at fully commented source code in `sample-client` directory. \r\n\r\nFor a working example, please have a look at `test` directory. You can fire-up your web server and browse to `index.html` in that directory. \r\nIf you like, you can find test page setup instructions for Apache under the `Deploy\\Dev\\Web Server` directory.\r\n\r\n<!---\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nProvide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.\r\n--->\r\n\r\n<!---\r\n## API Reference\r\n\r\nDepending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.\r\n--->\r\n\r\n<!---\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nDescribe and show how to run the tests with code examples.\r\n--->\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nLet people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.\r\n--->\r\n\r\n[pygy](https://github.com/pygy) for his [Romantic WTF Public License](https://github.com/pygy/The-Romantic-WTF-Public-License); \r\n[jxson](https://gist.github.com/jxson) for his [Readme.md template](https://gist.github.com/jxson/1784669).\r\n\r\n## Copyright and license\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nA short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)\r\n--->\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2014 [BrainCrumbz](http://www.braincrumbz.com).\r\n\r\n[Romantic WTF Public License](./license.md)\r\n\r\n## Fork it\r\n\r\nYour contributions are always welcome!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
